This directory contains regular expression api which should eventually 
land in GLib. We have put it here, since it didn't get enough testing
to put it into GLib 2.6. 

TODO items:
- Improve the Unicode support by making PCRE use the GLib Unicode functions.
- Maybe change the replace functions to replace only one match.
